## Assignment and Data Overview  
  
The task for this week is to migrate data from a relational database to a NoSQL database.  
  
The information I will be migrating was originally part the *nycflights13* data set--see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf) for background information.  The csv files and MySQL scripts used to populate the database tables were provided as part of a homework assignment in the CUNY Data Analytics, SQL bridge workshop.  These files can also be retrieved from my [Github repository](https://github.com/spitakiss/Data607_Project4).  
  
The NoSQL database that I use in this exercise is Neo4j.  Please note that the assignment solution is not entirely automated within R.  Instead, much of the work is done directly within the Neo4j environment.  For reproducibility purposes, however, I am including the Neo4j scripts within this R Markdown document.  
  
## Load Libraries  

```{r}
if (!require(RMySQL)) install.packages('RMySQL')
if (!require(getPass)) install.packages('getPass')
if (!require(RNeo4j)) install.packages('RNeo4j')
``` 
  
  
## MySQL DB Connection  
  
First, let's connect to the `flights_db` and store the tables in R as data frames.  
  
```{r}
# MySQL connection.  Using getPass() function to prompt user for username and password  
my_db = dbConnect(MySQL(), user=getPass(msg = 'Enter username'), password= getPass('Enter Password'), dbname='flights_db')

# create data frames
airlines_df <- dbGetQuery(my_db, "SELECT * FROM airlines;")
airports_df <- dbGetQuery(my_db,"SELECT * FROM airports;")
flights_df <- dbGetQuery(my_db,"SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 2000;")  # LIMIT TO 2000 ENTRIES FOR FAST EXECUTION
planes_df <- dbGetQuery(my_db,"SELECT * FROM planes;")
weather_df <- dbGetQuery(my_db,"SELECT * FROM weather;")

# db disconnect
dbDisconnect(my_db)

```
  

## Export to CSV  

Next, I'll, output the data frames as .csv files.  Note: the csv files should be saved in a folder named "import" within the larger directory where the Neo4j database is saved.  
  
```{r}
# make sure working directory is assigned appropriately--see example directory below
#setwd("D:/Learn/CUNY/flights_db/import")

# write dfs to csv format in working directory
write.csv(airlines_df, file = 'airlines.csv',row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(airports_df, file = 'airports.csv', row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(flights_df, file = 'flights.csv', row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(planes_df, file = 'planes.csv', row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(weather_df, file = 'weather.csv', row.names=FALSE)
```
  
## Migrate tables to Neo4j  

There is an R package, `RNeo4j`, that facilitates the manipulation of Neo4j graph objects within the R environment.  I experimented with this package and was able to establish a connection with my Neo4j database and run queries against existing Neo4j property graphs. However, I was not able to successfully commit the raw csv files from to Neo4j directly from R.  
  
To proceed with the assignment, I ran the scripts below directly in the Neo4j environment.  Going forward, I plan to continue working with `RNeo4j` or other packages with the intention of acheiving a more automated solution.  
  
**Load Tables in Neo4j**  
```{r, eval=FALSE}

//Clear Existing nodes and relationship from database
match (a) optional match (a)-[r]-() delete a,r;

//LOAD airlines table
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///airlines.csv" AS airlines
CREATE (al: Airline {car_id: airlines.carrier, car_name: airlines.name});

//LOAD airports table
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///airports.csv" AS airports
CREATE (ap: Airport {ap_id: airports.faa, ap_name: airports.name, lat:airports.lat, lon:airports.lon, alt: airports.alt, tz: airports.tz, dst: airports.dst});  

//LOAD planes table
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///planes.csv" AS planes
CREATE(p: Plane {tailnum: planes.tailnum, prod_yr: planes.year, p_type: planes.type, mfr: planes.manufacturer, model: planes.model, num_engines: planes.engines, seats: planes.seats, speed:planes.speed, engine_typ: planes.engine}); 
  
//LOAD flights table
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///flights.csv" AS flights
CREATE(f: Flight {year: flights.year, month: flights.month, day: flights.day, dep_time: flights.dep_time, arr_time: flights.arr_time, carrier: flights.carrier, flight_num: flights.flight, air_time: flights.air_time, distance: flights.distance, hour: flights.hour, minute: flights.minute});

//LOAD weather table
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///weather.csv" AS wth
CREATE(w: Weather {year:wth.year, month: wth.month, day:wth.day, hour:wth.hour, origin:wth.origin, temp:wth.temp, dewp:wth.dewp, humid:wth.humid, wind_dir:wth.wind_dir, wind_speed:wth.wind_speed, wind_gust:wth.wind_gust, precip:wth.precip, pressure: wth.pressure, visib:wth.visib}); 

```

Now, let's create relationship between various tables:  

**Neo4j Relationships**  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
//Relate Flight to Airline Carrier
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///flights.csv" AS flights
MATCH (a:Flight{carrier:flights.carrier})
MATCH (b:Airline{car_id:flights.carrier})
MERGE (a)-[r:IS_CARRIER]->(b);

//Relate Flight to plane info
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///flights.csv" AS flights
MATCH (a:Flight{flight_num:flights.flight, year:flights.year, month:flights.month, day:flights.day, dep_time:flights.dep_time, carrier:flights.carrier})
MATCH (b:Plane{tailnum:flights.tailnum})
MERGE (a)-[r:HAS_PLANE_INFO]->(b)

//Relate Flight to arrival airport
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///flights.csv" AS flights
MATCH (a:Flight{flight_num:flights.flight, year:flights.year, month:flights.month, day:flights.day, dep_time:flights.dep_time, carrier:flights.carrier})
MATCH (b:Airport{ap_id:flights.dest})
MERGE (a)-[r:ARRIVES{arr_delay:flights.arr_delay}]->(b)

//Relate Flight to destination
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///flights.csv" AS flights
MATCH (a:Flight{flight_num:flights.flight, year:flights.year, month:flights.month, day:flights.day, dep_time:flights.dep_time, carrier:flights.carrier})
MATCH (b:Airport{ap_id:flights.origin})
MERGE (a)-[r:LEAVES]->(b)

//Relate flight departure to weather conditons
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///flights.csv" AS flights
MATCH (a:Flight{flight_num:flights.flight, year:flights.year, month:flights.month, day:flights.day, dep_time:flights.dep_time, carrier:flights.carrier})
MATCH (b: Weather{year: flights.year, month: flights.month, day: flights.day, hour: flights.hour, origin:flights.origin})
MERGE (a)-[r:HAS_WEATHER]->(b)


```

## Example Queries  
  
As mentioned in the previous section, I was able to run queries against an established Neo4j database using the `RNeo4j` package.  

In the query below, I use `RNeo4j` to return airplane information for flights that traveled distances in excess of 2,000 miles:  

Please note:  `RNeo4j` is ostensibly only capable of returning data from Cypher queries that are in a tabular format.

```{r}
# establish connection with Neo4j 
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username=getPass("Enter username"),getPass("Enter password"))

# cypher code stored as string
query = 'MATCH(a:Flight)-[r:HAS_PLANE_INFO]->(b:Plane) WHERE toFloat(a.distance) > 2000 RETURN DISTINCT
            a.distance,b.seats,b.engine_typ ORDER BY a.distance DESC LIMIT 10'

# run query
cypher(graph, query)

```
  
Below is anexample of a Cypher query that was run directly in Neo4j.  This query produces a visual representation of the relationships described in the query:  
  
`MATCH p=()-[r:IS_CARRIER]->() RETURN p`:  

```{r}
myurl <-("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spitakiss/Data607_Project4/master/graph.png")
download.file(myurl,"C:/Users/Aaron/Downloads/graph.png", mode="wb")
```

## Pros and Cons of R NoSQL Databases
  
I will conclude this assignment with some basic observations about the pros and cons of working with a NoSQL database vs a traditional RDBMS.  
  
**Pros**  
  
* NOSQL queries often execute much faster than those used in relational models, particularly compared to SQL databases with 20+ table joins.  
* Data summaries and basic manipulations can often  be achieved using significantly less code; so code readability is improved.  
* NOSQL environments are not restricted to the rigid schema definitions imposed by typical RDMS models.  
  
**Cons**  
  
* Most software developers are comfortable working with SQL-based databases; however, there are far fewer individuals accustomed to working in NOSQL environments.  This can be a problem for employers with immediate business needs.  
* The rigidity imposed by RDMS models is often seen as a positive for employers with transactional processes that require near-perfect accuracy.  SQL-based systems are generally perceived as being superior to NOSQL models in this regard.
